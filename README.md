Welcome to My Mastermind!
A simple implementation of the famous guessing game.

Enter a number (-c flag needed) or let the program create a secret number.

Then type in a 4-digit combination (0 to 7 are allowed) on each turn. You have ten attempts by default, or choose your
own attempt number by using the -t flag.

Type 'quit' to exit the game.
Happy guessing!!
